It is the double-octafinal round at the Greenhill Fall Classic Debate Tournament in suburban Dallas, and the team from Lexington High School in Massachusetts has just flipped affirmative. That’s debate talk. In English, it means that because of a coin flip, the Lexington duo—Bennett Clifford and James Fraser—is now tasked with arguing in favor of this year’s resolution, which reads: “The United States federal government should substantially increase its exploration and/or development of space beyond the Earth’s mesosphere.” Their opponents, a pair of students from the Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville, Tennessee, are charged with negating the resolution.

Clifford and Fraser huddle with their coach and start assembling their arguments. Just a few years ago, they would have rifled through several 14-gallon Rubbermaid tubs filled with photocopied documents sorted into hanging files, manila folders, and accordion files. Now, they head straight to their laptops, tapping into a program called Debate Synergy that stores, organizes, and excerpts tens of thousands of pages of arguments. Their opponents, just 5 feet away, are doing much the same. The preparations are solemn and covert. Almost all discussion of strategy takes place via Google Chat.

After about 20 minutes, the judges call for the round to start. Fraser walks to the front of the room. With his square-rimmed glasses, high-cuffed jeans, and delicate features, he looks exactly like what he is in his free time: the lead singer for a fledgling indie-rock band. He sits, straight-backed, in his chair—keeping his diaphragm unencumbered throughout his presentation. He asks if everyone is ready. The audience grunts. Fraser begins:

“THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD—GASP—ESTABLISH LUNAR PROPERTY RIGHTS—FOR HELIUM-3 MINING! MOON RACE IS HAPP—GASP—MOONRACEISHAPPENING! A LEGAL—GASP—GASP—FRAMEWORKFORLANDDISTRIBUTION ISREQUIRED!”

The sentences fly out of Fraser’s mouth at about 350 words per minute, a good 100 words faster than a well-trained auctioneer, and they will keep flying out at that rate for eight straight minutes. His voice, normally slow and thoughtful, has jumped two octaves. He sounds a bit like Aaron Neville if Aaron Neville had swallowed a cat that had swallowed five pounds of Adderall.

Welcome to the esoteric world of Policy Debate. While high school debate comes in many varieties—the elevated discussion of Lincoln-Douglas debate, the quick-witted improvisation of Extemporaneous Speaking—Policy Debate attracts a uniquely intense breed. The event requires one team to argue in favor of a specific government policy, while the other team must point out the flaws in the plan. Each assertion must be supported by a piece of published evidence, and any argument that goes unchallenged, no matter how ridiculous on its face, is accepted as fact.

Policy debaters started talking fast in the 1960s, when a team from the University of Houston figured out that speed allowed them to cram more arguments into a timed speech than their opponents would physically be able to negate. Soon, students were talking like this at hundreds of competitions across the country every year. The innovation increased the demand for source material, the scholarly texts that support debaters’ arguments. That demand quickly outpaced supply—debaters had to track down their evidence in libraries, then photocopy and cut and paste it (with scissors and tape!) onto sheets of paper, which would in turn be tagged and filed away in tubs or banker boxes. When my high school debate career ended in 1998, “information technology” meant figuring out a way to sneak into a nearby college library, where, under the eye of a willfully blind old lady, I would steal access to LexisNexis.

The Internet has changed all that. Today’s debaters no longer have to painstakingly hunt through books and law reviews for new material. They enjoy instant access to a seemingly infinite number of published sources—not just articles and essays, but blog posts and even tweets. High school debaters are no longer hunters and foragers but highly efficient, thoroughly optimized information processors.
